# binary-insert
<b>Inserting an element into its sorted correct position using a version of binary search</b>

A very efficient way (because binary search is logarithmic O(log n)) to maintain a sorted list. This algorithm was initially written for
a list of strings, but would work for any datatype if the expression in the if statment is changed (marked by comment).
